####### Question 1 #######

Full Period: A random number generator (RNG) with a full period means that it can 
generate all possible numbers in its sequence before repeating. This is important 
because it ensures that the RNG can produce a wide variety of numbers without 
repeating too soon, which is crucial for simulations, cryptography, and other 
applications where randomness is important.


####### Question 2 #######

A seed is an initial value used to start the random number generation process. 
It determines the starting point in the sequence of random numbers. 

The main purpose of using a seed is to ensure reproducibility. By using the same 
seed, you can generate the same sequence of random numbers, which is useful for debugging, 
testing, and sharing results.

Without a Seed: If you do not specify a seed, the RNG will typically use a default seed, 
which might be based on the current time or some other system state. This means that each 
run of the program could produce different results, which is useful for generating truly 
random sequences but not for reproducibility.


####### Question 3 #######

using Random

function random_integer()
    return rand(1:100)
end
rant = random_integer()
println("My random number is: $rant")
# Everyting between 1 and 100

Random.seed!(42)
function nth_random_integer()
    return rand(1:100)
end

nth_ri = nth_random_integer()
println("My n-th random integer is: $nth_ri") 
#Usually 63
