When we make models we make assumptions about how the world works because
the world is quite complex. We therefor simplify things by assuming that
the world is linear, interdependence (that the variables are independent),
normality, stationarity and homogenity.


The process of comparing the outcome of historical data with the models
prediction is called model validation.


If the model output is vastly different from the real world system we 
might have taken the wrong assumptions. The model can be overfitted to the
historical data capturing too much noise or the model can be underfitting
and therefor too simple to capture the complexity. When the outcome of
model is underfitting the outcome is not captuing the underlying pattern
in the data and the variance is too low to be true.
