This means that CloakFloat reaches a state where it maximizes the utilization rate before the CloakSloth system. The CloakFloat is less expensive too looking at the total cost when it has reached a steady state. Given that the total time the system runs is lower and that it reaches a steady state where the deviation of the last 5 events is less than 10 percent, i would recommend CloakFloat."
